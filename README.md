# Description Mask-Detection-Using-Tensorflow
I created model for mask detection using library Tensorflow-python and implementing a neural network based on CNN architecture. My team and I successfully attained the goal in alignment with the initial target and  achieved 2nd place on Technoskill 1.0 Competition 2023 .
